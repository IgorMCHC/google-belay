Stickies is a simple Belay application

Stickies stores the note data itself, in its own database. Each sticky note,
therefore, has its own unique URL. This enables sharing - since if the data
were stored on the user's belay station (like hello does), then there would be
no way for another user to view it.

Station is free to update its code and data formats at anytime, since it is
in position of both on its servers.
